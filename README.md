## Work Experience
### Deep Learning Research Intern | Alzheimerâ€™s Dementia Detection using Audio
- May 2023 - present
- Using Deep Learning based acoustic analysis to diagnose dementia in early stages using audio
- Tools & technologies used: Tensorflow, Audacity, Keras, Pandas, IPython
- Extracted bio-inspired Gammatone coefficients from audio interviews of elderly individuals from famous ADReSSo
dataset
- Implemented EfficientNet to classify audio spectrogram derivatives for acoustic dementia detection.

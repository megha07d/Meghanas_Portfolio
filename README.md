### AI Engineer Intern (ADAS)  
**Nov 2023 – Sep 2024**  
**Valeo India, Chennai**

- Worked on ADAS-based deep learning model deployment and optimization for automated parking technology in the upcoming BMW Neue Klasse series, utilizing Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride platform.
- Applied quantization techniques like Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to convert ADAS models from floating-point precision to INT8 for various clients, ensuring minimal accuracy loss and stable on-device performance.
- Enhanced a 12-decoder level ADAS model by replacing operations with hardware-efficient alternatives, maintaining performance and accuracy.
- Contributed to pipeline automation, reducing work time from 3 days to half a day, significantly accelerating release cycles.
- Developed LIDAR data visualizations for real-time assessment of ADAS model performance, ensuring high reliability.

### Deep Learning Research Intern | Alzheimer’s Dementia Detection using Audio  
**May 2023 – August 2023**  
**Indian Institute of Information Technology Chennai**
- Identification of important Cepstrals for Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Dementia using deep learning-based acoustic analysis.
- Tools & technologies used: TensorFlow, Audacity, Keras, Pandas, IPython, Origin.
- Extracted log Mel, MFCC, GFCC, and BFCC cepstral coefficients from audio interviews of elderly individuals from the famous Interspeech ADReSS challenge dataset.
- Implemented a customized EfficientNet B0 model to classify audio samples for Alzheimer’s dementia detection using pure acoustic signals.
- Achieved 73% classification accuracy with a 0.73 precision rate, one of the best results using pure acoustics.
- Acoustic nature of the model makes it globally applicable and consistent performance makes it suitable to be extended to real-time evaluation for AD diagnosis.

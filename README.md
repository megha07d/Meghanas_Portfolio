**Valeo India, Chennai**

- Worked on ADAS-based deep learning model deployment and optimization for automated parking technology in the upcoming BMW Neue Klasse series, utilizing Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride platform.
- Applied quantization techniques like Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to convert ADAS models from floating-point precision to INT8 for various clients, ensuring minimal accuracy loss and stable on-device performance.
- Enhanced a 12-decoder level ADAS model by replacing operations with hardware-efficient alternatives, maintaining performance and accuracy.
- Contributed to pipeline automation, reducing work time from 3 days to half a day, significantly accelerating release cycles.
- Developed LIDAR data visualizations for real-time assessment of ADAS model performance, ensuring high reliability.


## Work Experience
### Deep Learning Research Intern | Alzheimer’s Dementia Detection using Audio
- May 2023 - August 2023
- Identification of important Cepstrals for Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Dementia using Deep learning based acoustic analysis
- Tools & technologies used: Tensorflow, Audacity, Keras, Pandas, IPython, Origin
- Extracted log Mel, MFCC, GFCC and BFCC cesptral coefficients from audio interviews of elderly individuals from famous Interspeech ADReSS challenge dataset.
- Implemented customized EfficientNet B0 model to classify audio samples for Alzheimer’s dementia detection using pure acoustic signals
- Achieved 73% classification accuracy with 0.73 precision rate, one of the best results using pure acoustics
- Acoustic nature of the model makes it globally applicable and consistent performance makes it suitable to be extended to real time evaluation for AD diagnosis.

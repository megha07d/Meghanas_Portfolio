## Work Experience
### Deep Learning Research Intern | Alzheimer’s Dementia Detection using Audio
- May 2023 - present
- Identification of important Cepstrals for Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Dementia using Deep learning based acoustic analysis
- Tools & technologies used: Tensorflow, Audacity, Keras, Pandas, IPython, Origin
- Extracted log Mel, MFCC, GFCC and BFCC cesptral coefficients from audio interviews of elderly individuals from famous Interspeech ADReSS challenge dataset.
- Implemented customized EfficientNet B0 model to classify audio samples for Alzheimer’s dementia detection using pure acoustic signals
- Achieved 73% classification accuracy with 0.73 precision rate, one of the best results using pure acoustics
- Acoustic nature of the model makes it globally applicable and consistent performance makes it suitable to be extended to real time evaluation for AD diagnosis.
